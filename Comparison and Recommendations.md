# Comparison of Results and Recommendations

Below we see the results of the segments as a result of the two requests we made by dividing them into 4 clusters and 5 clusters.
segments with a conspicuously high difference between them; At Risk, Hibernating, New Customers, Potential Loyalists and Promising.

The At Risk and Hibernating segments include clients that I have lost or are about to lose. While their number is low when I use 4 clusters, if we narrow down the results and break them into 5 clusters, we see that they are quite high. In this context, it would be more logical to examine the customers in 5 clusters instead of 4 clusters. That way, more solid steps can be taken to minimize customer loss.

We should try to reconnect with customers in the About to Sleep segment. We can win them back by offering special discounts, popular offers and sharing our valuable resources with them.

In order to reconnect customers in “At Risk”, we may try to bring them back by sending them personalized emails or other personalized messages.

The Can't Lose customer segment is one of the segments that should be given importance. These are the customers we don't want to lose. This group has not been shopping for a long time, but the total number of purchases is quite high. We can conduct surveys and get their opinions to find out what went wrong in that segment. We should also offer campaigns that make these customers feel valued.

Focusing on satisfying customers in the Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, and Promising segments should be a priority. It will be a plus to reach them in a more personalized way, by analyzing their individual preferences and affinities more. For example, personal messages such as birthday wishes can be sent. New promotions for products can be reported early.

People in the Need Attention segment are the customer group we tend to lose by showing averages both in time and in terms of total purchases, while at the same time it doesn't take much effort to win. We may make limited time offers in this segment that will entice them to shop with us. We can recommend products based on previous purchases. This way we can reactivate them so that they can shop.

The customer group New Customers are groups who recently had new contacts. We need to increase the overall purchases of this segment. We should have them come to us often, even for small sums. We can organize special promotions for new customers.
